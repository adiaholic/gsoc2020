&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am a final year undergraduate student at Pune Institute of Computer Technology majoring in Information Technology, India graduating in 2020.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the guidance of mentors and contributors at <a href="https://www.igniterealtime.org/"> IgniteRealtime </a>, I got an opportunity to be a part of <a href="https://xmpp.org/about/xmpp-standards-foundation.html">XMPP Standards Foundation<a href=""></a> through the annual <a href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/">Google Summer of Code</a> program. A brief overview of my GSoC project can be found <a href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/projects/#4611553850032128"> here </a>.

This blog is a medium to track my progress, through weekly my posts.
