Hi,<br>
&emsp; It is difficult to test classes performing IO operation using normal JUnit tests. And hence I moved on towards using mockito. Through mockito I was able to add more unit tests which led to an increase in the overall code coverage.</p>


<p align="justify">
&emsp; Another significant improvement is that I was able to remove another WebsocketConnectionPhase, readyToReceiveFeatures from the implementation. This now means that there are only three phases in websocket connection.
</p>

<p align="justify">
&emsp; OpenElement and CloseElement from the websocket module now extend StreamOpen and StreamClose respectively. However, this hierarchy is prone to modifications under the newly opened #420.
</p>

&emsp; After lot of playing with debuggers, I now am able to obtain pretty output for the sent and received data between the client and the server.
