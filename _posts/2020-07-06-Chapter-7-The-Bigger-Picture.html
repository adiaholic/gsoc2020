Hi,<br>

&emsp; This was the first week of my second work period.</p>

<p align="justify">
&emsp; This week, I could handle multiple endpoints. Previously, only the first endpoint was being used to make a connection. Now, we check endpoints one-by-one until connection is establised or connections through all endpoints results in failure. All these connection failures are wrapped around in a `WebsocketException`.
</p>

<p align="justify">
&emsp; Apart from this, some modifications have been made into the code base in accordance with reviews recieved from mentors. I now have a successful build and can generate ModularXmppClientToServerConnectionStateGraph with websocket module pitched into the Finite State Machine(FSM). </p>

Showing the generated FSM:

&emsp; 	Furter I am going to work on pluggable implementations and existing code improvisation.

<i>Thank you. See you next week.</i><br>
