Hello everyone,<br>

&emsp; This week has been pretty amazing. Prior to GSoC, I had some commits which added support for a particular XEP, but I had always been curious to know what exactly happens under the hood, how these connections are established, etc.</p>


<p align="justify">
&emsp; As of now, I am able to achieve success SASL authentication. This means that the code snippet actually works,</p>

<code><pre>ModularXmppClientToServerConnection connection = new ModularXmppClientToServerConnection(config);<br>connection.connect();<br>connection.login();<br></pre></code>
	

<p align="justify">
To monitor the course of SASL authentication, I have introduced `WebsocketConnectionPhases`. These phases keep track over status of the connection, right from `attemptingWebsocketHandshakes` till the connection is in phase `exchangingStanzas`.

&emsp; In the coming week, I would want to make methods more modular to remove redundancy and find a way to make websocket base library pluggable.</p>

<i>That is all for now. See you next week!</i><br>
