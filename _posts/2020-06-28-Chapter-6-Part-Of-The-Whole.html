Hi there,<br>

&emsp; This week was exciting. I started off with polishing the XEP-0156 PR and got it production ready. With the help of continuous feedback from mentors I could get my XEP-0156 implementation merged. Yayy \0/ !</p>

<p align="justify">
But wait, this is not the highlight of the week ;) <br>
&emsp; While going through XEPs, I realised that the abstract to XEP-0156 was incomplete. And thus my first ever pull request to make minor changes into the XEP came into existence. I have not been happier. Irrespective of the fact that there are possibilities in which the change doesn't get accepted, I am happy.

&emsp; It is true that one cannot have a tenacious grip on some context without having practical knowledge. So, I have started following more and more discussions on the xsf muc. The muc is quite active and the discussions provide me a perspective. All in all, it is an enriching experience.</p>

&emsp; In coming week, I want to incorporate my XEP-0156 implementation in websocket transport along with other changes. I look forward to whats coming up next!</p>

<i>See you next week!</i><br>
