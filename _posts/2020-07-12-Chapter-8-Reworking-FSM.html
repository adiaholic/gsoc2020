Hi,<br>

&emsp; This week I made some changes required to develop appropriate finite state machine graph. We can now see that `EstablishingWebsocketConnection` is an alternative state to `EstablisingTcpConnection`.</p>

<p align="justify">
	The corresponding graph is as shown below,

    <br>
</p>


<p align="justify">
&emsp; Few other significant changes are:<br>
<ul>
	<li>The previous `handshake()` method is now `connect()`. And corresponding to it, closingHandshake() is renamed to `disconnect()`.</li>
	<li>`AbstractWebsocketImpl` is now `AbstractWebsocket`.</li>
	<li>Have started adding test cases.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p align="justify">
&emsp; Now that we have the websocket codebase in better shape than what it was a few weeks before, I feel that this is the right time to add documentation wherever necessary and also I will start writing test cases.</p>
